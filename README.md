- By clicking the **`[Open YAML File]`** button, you can open a premade OpenUTAU YAML dictionary to edit them directly with this GUI toolkit. The **`[Append YAML File]`** button's function is to merge multiple YAML files so that users can merge them together.

- You can add the graphemes and phonemes onto the Manual Entry section. Pressing the **`[Add Entry]`** button will add them to the Entries viewer. Using the **`[Delete Entry]`** button or the delete button on your keyboard will delete the selected entry. By clicking the entries first then `shift` + `click` to other entries will highlight them so that users can batch delete the entries using the **`[Delete Entry]`** button or the delete keyboard button.
## Using OpenUtau YAML Templates or Custom Template

- Using the combobox picker, users can choose their OpenUtau YAML template to create their dictionary. Also, users can add their own templates by placing them in the **`[Templates]`** folder so the GUI toolkit will recognize the files via the templates.ini and use them for dictionary creation.
